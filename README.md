# nmf
Core codes are based on nmf.py from Chih-Jen Lin, National Taiwan University, Python translated by Anthony Di Franco

Currently, codes are under editing for implementing customized functions.

Progress will be recorded here.

Ideas:
- Add an initialization method to generate the matrices randomly. (checked)
- Edit the nlssubprob function, which only supports square matrix in the original codes. (in progress)
- Error is a bit crazy…………
